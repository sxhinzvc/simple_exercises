#Java Collections
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21974361/what-java-collection-should-i-use

Collection - anything holding data called "elements" (of the same type)

List - indexed collection of data where each element has an index. Like an array, but more flexible.

Set - a bag of unique elements.

Map - similar to List, but instead of accessing the elements by their integer index, you access them by their key
 
The main difference between the Set and the Map is that in the Set you search data by themselves, whilst in the map by their key.

#Chapter1

##UniqueStringValidator:
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

##StringComparator:
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
